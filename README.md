> The SAP start service runs on every computer where an instance of the Application Server ABAP (AS ABAP) is started. It is implemented as a service on Windows, and as a daemon on UNIX. The process is called sapstartsrv.exe on Windows, and sapstartsrv on UNIX platforms.
> The SAP start service provides the following functions for monitoring ABAP systems, application server instances (AS instance), and processes.
> - Starting and stopping
> - Monitoring the runtime state
> - Reading logs, traces, and configuration files
> - Technical information, such as network ports, active sessions, thread lists, etc.
